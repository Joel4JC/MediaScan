MediaScan v1.22

This version of MediaScan requires the Access Database: dbMediaScan.accdb
It must be located at: C:\MediaScan as of v1.22 July 9, 2018

The Database Updater is only for converting a Database from version 1.09 to the current version.

The intention of this program is to scan media brought into a Data Center/Office Space from an
outside source. This will create a listing of every file on the Media, as well as, storing that
information in a database for reporting purposes. If it encounters a .zip file, it will report
on the files in the .zip file without extracting the files.

The program lacks the ability to get a listing of files stored in other compress archive formats,
such as, .rar, .cab, 7z, .gz and others. If you decide to add one of these features, or any other
feature, please push your changes back to this repository. Thanks in advance.

The code could be cleaner but, I had to put this together on my limited personal time, because 
employer didn't see a need for it, or a programmer to develope it. Feel free to add some best
practices and/or design patterns.

The log files and listings are stored in the same directory as the database: C:\MediaScan.

Enjoy and please share your enhancements.
